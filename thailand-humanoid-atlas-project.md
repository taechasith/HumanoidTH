# Thailand Humanoid Atlas

## Project Goal

Thailand Humanoid Atlas is an open-source research database platform for mapping the humanoid and social-robotics ecosystem in Thailand.

The platform should collect, normalize, classify, and visualize four connected layers:

1. **Public and media perspectives** on humanoid, service, companion, education, medical, and social robots in Thailand.
2. **Contributions** from researchers, creators, labs, universities, companies, students, communities, and open-source builders.
3. **Robot model registry**, including commercial models, research prototypes, service robots, humanoid platforms, and imported robots used in Thailand.
4. **Owned robot inventory**, meaning the specific models that the project team owns, borrows, operates, tests, repairs, or deploys.

The first version should not try to be a perfect national robot census. It should be a transparent research atlas with provenance, confidence scores, audit trails, and community submission.

## Recommended Initial Data Sources

### Must-Have for V1

1. **Seed YAML / CSV**
   - The safest first adapter.
   - Use it for robot models, owned inventory, known Thai robot companies, known university labs, and manually curated source URLs.

2. **RSS + Web Fetch**
   - News sites, university news, company blogs, government announcements.
   - Store source URL, title, excerpt, published date, and source metadata.

3. **GDELT / Global News Search**
   - Useful for broad news/media monitoring.
   - Use queries such as:
     - `humanoid robot Thailand`
     - `social robot Thailand`
     - `Dinsaw robot`
     - `หุ่นยนต์ฮิวแมนนอยด์ ไทย`
     - `หุ่นยนต์ดูแลผู้สูงอายุ ดินสอ`

4. **YouTube Data API**
   - Search for public videos and collect metadata.
   - Store title, channel, description excerpt, published date, view count, like count when available, and comments only when allowed and necessary.

5. **OpenAlex**
   - Research papers, authors, institutions, topics, citations, and concepts.
   - Query around humanoid robotics, social robotics, service robots, elder-care robots, Thailand, Thai universities, and HRI.

6. **Manual Submission / Approved Export for TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, Reddit**
   - Do not build risky scrapers first.
   - Start with URL submissions, public embeds, approved API access, or manually exported metadata.

7. **GitHub REST API**
   - Public robotics repositories, organization repos, code contributions, issues, releases, and stars.

8. **Data.go.th / Thai Government Open Data**
   - Optional for industry, education, health, aging society, innovation, and robotics-related datasets.

## Relevance Classifier Rules

A record is accepted when both conditions are true:

1. It is related to humanoid/social/service robots or embodied AI.
2. It has a Thailand connection through location, organization, deployment, creator, media audience, event, market entry, or public discussion.

### Accept Examples

- Article about Dinsaw Robot in Thai hospitals.
- YouTube video reviewing a humanoid robot event in Bangkok.
- Thai university project about social robots.
- Public post discussing robots replacing jobs in Thailand.
- Team-owned Unitree/UBTech/NAO/other robot inventory record.

### Reject Examples

- Generic ChatGPT news with no robot embodiment.
- Industrial automation news with no human-facing robot relevance.
- Foreign humanoid robot news with no Thai connection.
- Personal private comments or private group posts.

### Uncertain Examples

- “AI robot” article where it may mean chatbot.
- Restaurant delivery robot with no social/humanoid interaction.
- Vendor press release claiming Thailand launch without independent evidence.

---

## Perspective Extraction Output

Every media/source record can have one or more perspective annotations.

```json
{
  "stance": "cautious_supportive",
  "sentiment": "mixed",
  "perception_theme": "job_displacement",
  "target_entity": "humanoid robots in service jobs",
  "evidence_excerpt": "short excerpt from the source",
  "confidence": 0.72,
  "method": "llm_with_evidence"
}
```

Rules:

- Do not infer public opinion from a single post.
- Label the data as “observed media signals,” not “Thailand public opinion.”
- Keep source provenance visible.
- Use aggregation only when sample size is meaningful.
- Separate creator framing from audience comments.

---

## Relationship Triplets

Allowed relations for V1:

```text
organization -> developed -> robot_model
organization -> deployed -> robot_model
robot_model -> used_for -> use_case
robot_model -> deployed_in -> place_or_institution
person -> affiliated_with -> organization
person -> contributed_to -> project
source -> discusses -> robot_model_or_topic
source -> expresses_concern_about -> theme
source -> supports -> theme_or_robot_model
contribution -> uses -> robot_model_or_tool
contribution -> released_as -> repo_paper_dataset_demo
owned_inventory -> instance_of -> robot_model
owned_inventory -> located_at -> location_label
```

---

## Data Governance

### Public Data Rule

The platform should store public metadata, source URLs, short excerpts, and analysis labels. It should avoid storing full comments or personal data unless the source license and platform terms clearly allow it.

### Private Inventory Rule

Owned inventory should default to private visibility. Public pages should hide serial numbers, precise storage location, purchase documents, and security-sensitive maintenance details unless explicitly marked public-safe.

### Contribution Claim Rule

A person or organization can submit a contribution claim, but it remains pending until reviewed. Public contributor profiles should not expose emails, phone numbers, private addresses, or sensitive personal identifiers.

### Corrections and Takedown

Add a visible correction request pathway. Every source detail page should include provenance and “request correction” action.

## CLI Agent Prompt

```text
Build an open-source Thailand Humanoid Atlas platform in this repository.

Project topic:
Thailand humanoid and social robotics ecosystem.

Project scope:
Public and curated records about humanoid, social, companion, healthcare, education, service, and embodied-AI robots connected to Thailand, plus contribution records and robot models owned or operated by the project team.

Main goal:
Create a repeatable research database platform that collects public records, normalizes them, classifies relevance, extracts media/public perspectives, maps contributors and organizations, tracks robot models, tracks project-owned robot inventory, and exposes the data through an analyst-friendly web UI.

Important grounding:
Use the uploaded Open Source Research Atlas guide as the base architecture. Keep the pipeline pattern: source adapters -> normalized records -> dedupe -> relevance -> taxonomy/entity classification -> relationship extraction -> stats/graph cache -> FastAPI/Jinja UI -> submissions/admin review. Extend it for humanoid robotics, public perspective analysis, contribution records, robot model registry, and owned inventory.

Stack requirements:
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- Jinja2
- SQLite first, clean path to PostgreSQL/Supabase later
- Typer CLI
- Pydantic
- httpx
- NetworkX
- pandas/openpyxl for export if available
- pytest
- Playwright smoke tests if the repo already supports it or if it can be added safely

Core pages:
- /
- /dashboard
- /perspectives
- /robots
- /inventory
- /contributions
- /network
- /analytics
- /database
- /submit-data
- /profile
- /admin/submitted-data

Core CLI:
- db init
- ingest seeds
- ingest rss
- ingest gdelt
- ingest youtube
- ingest openalex
- ingest github
- filter relevance
- analyze perspectives
- analyze nlp
- analyze graph
- analyze stats
- export csv
- serve

Data source adapters for V1:
1. seed_yaml: required; no credentials needed.
2. rss/web_fetch: public pages and university/company/government news.
3. gdelt: public news discovery.
4. youtube: optional, requires YOUTUBE_API_KEY.
5. openalex: public research metadata.
6. github: public repositories and contribution metadata.
7. manual_social: manual URL submission and approved metadata for Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X, Reddit, or other platforms where automated access is restricted.

Do not build risky scrapers. Respect robots.txt, platform terms, API permissions, and copyright. Store source URLs, metadata, and short excerpts rather than redistributing full text when licensing is unclear.

Database requirements:
Start from the base OpenAtlas schema for sources, geo, entities, triplets, stats_cache, and submitted_data. Add these domain tables:
- robot_models
- owned_inventory
- contributions
- perspective_annotations
- pipeline_runs if not already present

Taxonomy requirements:
Create config/taxonomy.yml or data/taxonomy.yml with:
- robot_type
- embodiment_level
- perspective_theme
- stance
- sentiment
- contribution_type
- thailand_status
- source_type
- confidence_bucket

Perspective extraction:
For each accepted source, extract stance, sentiment, perception theme, target entity, evidence excerpt, confidence, and method. Add an abstention state when evidence is thin. Do not claim this represents all Thai public opinion; label it as observed public/media signals.

Owned inventory:
Default visibility should be private. Public views must hide serial numbers, precise storage location, purchase documents, and security-sensitive repair details unless marked public-safe.

Contribution records:
Allow community submissions for research papers, software repositories, hardware designs, datasets, demos, workshops, media analysis, field observations, translations, repairs, robot deployments, student projects, and policy reports. Require admin review before publishing.

Build order:
Phase 0: Inspect repo and report plan.
Phase 1: Config, package metadata, CLI skeleton.
Phase 2: Database schema, migrations, repositories.
Phase 3: Seed YAML adapter and initial seed files.
Phase 4: Relevance classifier and taxonomy.
Phase 5: Robot model registry and owned inventory pages.
Phase 6: Perspective annotation pipeline.
Phase 7: Contributions and submission/admin review.
Phase 8: GDELT/RSS/OpenAlex/GitHub/YouTube adapters with graceful missing-key behavior.
Phase 9: Network graph, analytics, cached APIs.
Phase 10: UI polish, export, tests, Playwright validation, docs.

Operating rules:
- Work phase by phase.
- Before each phase, state files to create/edit and checks to run.
- After each phase, stop and report completed work, changed files, commands/tests run, errors, missing credentials, outside-editor tasks, and readiness for approval.
- Use safe local fallbacks when keys are missing.
- Never hard-code private team inventory into public seed files unless visibility is explicitly set.
- Do not delete unrelated user changes.
- Do not mark a phase complete until checks pass or blockers are clearly listed.

Acceptance checks for MVP:
- `python -m humanoid_atlas db init` creates all required tables and indexes.
- Running db init twice is safe.
- Seed ingest inserts robot models and owned inventory without duplicates.
- Relevance classifier handles accepted, rejected, and uncertain examples.
- Perspective pipeline creates evidence-based annotations or abstains.
- Robot registry, inventory, contribution, database, analytics, network, and admin pages render.
- Export works for sources, robot_models, owned_inventory, contributions, and perspective_annotations.
- Tests cover schema, ingest idempotency, classifier outputs, graph empty states, and protected admin routes.
```

## UI/UX Creation Prompt

```text
Design the UI/UX for Thailand Humanoid Atlas, an open-source research database platform for Thailand's humanoid and social robotics ecosystem.

Product meaning:
This is not a marketing landing page. It is a dense, credible research atlas that helps users understand how Thailand discovers, discusses, builds, owns, and deploys humanoid/social robots.

Primary users:
- Robotics researchers
- HRI researchers
- Students
- Media researchers
- Policy and innovation teams
- Event/exhibition organizers
- Robotics contributors
- CreativeLabTH/internal operators
- Admin reviewers

Primary workflows:
1. Understand the current corpus at a glance.
2. Explore public/media perspectives by platform, theme, stance, sentiment, and time.
3. Browse robot models connected to Thailand.
4. Inspect project-owned robot inventory safely, with private/public visibility rules.
5. Discover contributors, organizations, labs, papers, demos, and repositories.
6. Explore relationship graph between robots, people, institutions, media, and themes.

- Owned Inventory
- Contributions
- Network Graph
- Analytics
- Database Browser
- Submit Data
- User Profile
- Admin Review Queue

Design direction:
Use a modern research-console style: compact, serious, legible, and exploratory. Avoid generic SaaS hero sections, oversized cards, vague gradients, and marketing copy. The app should feel like a public-interest research instrument with a lab-grade interface.

Information architecture:
Use a persistent left sidebar on desktop and bottom/tab navigation or drawer navigation on mobile.
Top-level navigation:
- Overview
- Perspectives
- Robots
- Inventory
- Contributions
- Network
- Analytics
- Database
- Submit
- Admin

Home screen requirements:
- Show corpus size, source count, year range, latest pipeline update, robot model count, owned inventory count, contribution count, and pending review count.
- Show quick filters: year, platform, robot type, perspective theme, confidence.
- Show direct action buttons: Explore perspectives, Browse robots, Add source, Review queue.
- Empty state must tell the operator what CLI command to run next.

Perspectives screen requirements:
- Main chart: perspective theme over time.
- Side panel: stance/sentiment distribution.
- Platform filter: news, YouTube, academic, company, government, manual social, GitHub, submissions.
- Evidence table: source title, platform, theme, stance, confidence, excerpt, date.
- Clearly label the data as observed media/public signals, not complete public opinion.
- Show low-confidence labels with warning badges.

Robot registry screen requirements:
- Card/table hybrid for robot models.
- Filters: robot type, embodiment level, Thailand status, manufacturer, use case, confidence.
- Each robot detail page should show description, source evidence, deployment/use cases, related contributions, related media, and graph neighbors.
- Status badge examples: developed in Thailand, deployed in Thailand, imported, observed, owned by project, rumored/unverified.

Owned inventory screen requirements:
- Default to private/operator mode.
- Public-safe mode must hide serial numbers, precise location, purchase documents, and sensitive maintenance notes.
- Show model, display name, condition, ownership status, custodian, visibility, accessories, documentation status, and last updated.
- Add clear warnings before exposing private inventory fields.

Contributions screen requirements:
- Show contributions by type: research, software, hardware, dataset, demo, workshop, media analysis, field observation, repair, deployment, student project.
- Allow filtering by organization, robot model, license, verification status, and year.
- Contribution detail page should show source, contributor display name, organization, related robot, evidence, license, and verification status.

Network screen requirements:
- 2D graph first, 3D optional.
- Node types: robot, organization, person, source, topic, contribution, place, owned inventory.
- Edge examples: developed, deployed, used_for, discusses, affiliated_with, contributed_to, expresses_concern_about, instance_of.
- Node click opens a detail drawer with neighbors, evidence, confidence, and source links.
- Include search, relation filter, confidence filter, and graph size limit.
- Empty state should explain whether no triplets exist or filters are too narrow.

Analytics screen requirements:
- Trend charts with sample size.
- Engagement statistics should use log1p/geometric summaries where appropriate.
- Show confidence intervals and insufficient-data states.
- Method note must explain that correlations and media trends are not causal claims.

Database screen requirements:
- Dense table with stable columns and horizontal scrolling only inside the table container.
- Search by title, URL, robot model, organization, theme, entity, relation.
- Filters must remain visible after scrolling.
- Detail drawer should show raw metadata, derived labels, source evidence, and admin actions if authorized.
- Include CSV/XLSX export controls.

Submit-data requirements:
Submission types:
- Source URL
- Robot model
- Owned inventory update
- Contribution claim
- Event/demo record
- Correction request

Show statuses:
- queued
- fetching
- analyzed
- needs review
- approved
- rejected
- failed

If AI analysis is used, show evidence excerpt and confidence. If API keys are missing, show a graceful degraded state and let the user submit manually.

Admin requirements:
- Optimize for review speed.
- Use split view: submitted data on left, automated analysis/evidence on right.
- Actions: approve, reject, edit, merge duplicate, request more info, mark private, publish public-safe version.
- Non-admin users must not see admin actions.

Design system:
- Use color roles, not only palette names:
  - background
  - surface
